        <p>This program is actually very cool. I especially like that it closes the element for you as you type the opening.
            <br> That way, you don't miss any closings.
            <br> I also really like that when you type "quotations," it automatically does close quotations, because I keep missing those in my code.

        <p>It also tries to fill in path files for you, which is very handy.</p>
