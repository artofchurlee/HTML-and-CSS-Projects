	<p> Dogs are a man's best friend- I love dogs! </p>
	<blockquote cite = "https://www.shutterfly.com/ideas/dog-quotes/">
	<p>I like dogs. You always know what a dog is thinking. It has four moods. Happy, sad, cross, and concentrating. Also, dogs are faithful and they do not tell lies because they cannot talk.</P>
