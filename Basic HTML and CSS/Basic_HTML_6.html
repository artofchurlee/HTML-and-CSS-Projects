	<article>
		<p>Love is not who you were expecting.<br>
		Love is not what you can predict.<br>
		Maybe Love is in New York City already asleep.<br>
		You are in California, &nbsp;Australia, &nbsp;wide awake.<br>
		<span style= "color: #FF0000">Maybe Love is always in the wrong time-zone.<br>
		Maybe Love is not ready for you.<br>
		Maybe you are not ready for Love.<br></span></p>
